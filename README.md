## INTRODUCTION

WebNomad is a set of shell scripts to generate websites and image
galleries fit for desktop as well mobile and tablet browsing. It can
be operated on any device running ZShell, its themes are based on
Bootstrap CSS, pages can be written in Markdown syntax interlaced into
HTML, while it uses JQuery and BlueImp to make slideshows using all
files found into a directory.

## USE INSTRUCTIONS 

As of now, webnomad is operated from a Terminal.  A simple interface
might be built in future if donors request it.

## BASIC USAGE

First create a directory for your website, then place the webnomad
directory inside it, i.e. the one downloaded from the source archive
or git repo.

From a terminal, cd inside your new website's directory and run:

    ./webnomad/init 

the skeleton of your new webpage is created inside the directory:

    views/ -> contains the pages you want to edit
    tmpl/ -> contains templates like header, footer and navbar

Now go customise files in `tmpl/` with your favorite HTML editor and
then go as well in `views/` to create your web pages, better start from
index.html.

To see results, run `./webnomad/render` and your webpages will be in
pub/ with all markdown rendered, header navbar and footer applied. To
preview open the `pub/index` file with a web browser (chromium is
recommended, since it does not need the .html extension on local
files...)

Upload your website with a recursive Scp or Rsync from `pub/*` on any
webserver.

## USE MARKDOWN

To avoid the tedious task of using HTML tags for everything, even
simple formatted text, webnomad supports interlacing markdown sections
within an HTML page. This is simply done opening and closing the tags
`<markdown> ... </markdown>` which can recur more than once in the
same document.

This approach simplifies the use of markdown within a bootstrap styled
page, where you can use the `<div>` classes of bootstrap as usual,
directly in HTML, but then go on filling them up with our beloved
simplified markup - *cough* *cough* - markdown.

## IMAGE SLIDESHOW

To create an image slideshow simply create a page with file extension
`.gal` or `.gallery` inside the `views/` directory, for example one
can call it views/vacation_in_Italy.gal

To add images into it one should create a -files directory inside
`views/` better if named after the gallery page, something like:
views/vacation_in_Italy-files/

Proceed copying your images inside the -files directory, resized to
the format you want them to appear in the slideshow. One can also use
`webnomad/convert` an optional script that helps to do batch
conversions.

Now fill in the filenames of your images inside the `.gallery` file, one
per line, relative to the `views/` path. For instance our
views/vacation_in_Italy.gallery file can contain:

    vacation_in_Italy-files/Fontana_di_Trevi.jpeg
    vacation_in_Italy-files/Torre_di_Pisa.jpeg
    vacation_in_Italy-files/Er_cupolone.jpeg
    vacation_in_Italy-files/Spiaggia_con_bagnanti.jpeg
    vacation_in_Italy-files/Io_e_te_sudati.jpeg

At last run `webnomad/render` and the slideshow will be ready at the
page in `pub/` which in our case is pub/vacation_in_Italy.

## DIRECTORY INDEXES

Using webnomad One can also create static web pages indexing all files
into any filesystem directories recursively, making thumbnail previews
of images and linking to the originals.

In order to do so create a file in views with extension `.idx` or
`.index`, then fill it in with the needed configurations, for instance a
file my_pictures_folder.index can contain one line (# is a comment)

    # path to be indexed    url subfolder    index type
    /home/jaromil/pics      pics             short

This will produce a pics/index.html url which will list
all files inside that directory with previews and further links to
subfolders that are indexed the same way.

In some cases it can be useful to serve the actual downloads from a
different place than `WEB_ROOT`, be it another server for assets or an
apache alias. To configure this use `FILES_ROOT` in config.zsh.
